Write a function that print the string "Hello World" on a single line. It must be prototyped as follows:

`func printHelloWold()`

### Task 02

Write a function that, beginning with a, displays the lowercase alphabet in ascending order, on a single line. It must be prototyped as follows:

`func printAlphabet()`

### Task 03

Write a function that, beginning with 1, displays all the digits in ascending order, on a single line. It must be prototyped as follows:

`func printDigits()`

### Task 04

Write a function that displays either N if the the integer passed as paramaeter is negative, P, if positive or null. It must be prototyped as follows:

`func isNeg(n int)`

### Task 05 

Write a function that displays, in ascending order, all the numbers composed by three different digits numbers (012,013,014,015,016,017,018,019,023,...,789). Given three digits (all different), only the smallest number composed by those digits must be displayed. It must be prototyped as follows:

`func printComb()`

### Task 06

Write a function that displays, in ascending order, all the different combinations of two-digit numbers (00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05,...,01 99, 02 03,..., 98 99). It must be prototyped as follows:

`func printComb2()`
